% separation locations for rel = 1e3,4,5
The separation location was found to be $x/L = 0.5$ for all values of the Reynolds Number $Re_L = [10^3, 10^4, 10^5]$. This is because separation depends only on the shape factors 'gradient parameter' which itself does not depend on $Re_L$.\\[5pt]


% value of rel at which transition supplants separation
The value of $Re_L$ at which transition supplants separation to two significant figures was found to be $Re_L = 9.7\times10^5$
