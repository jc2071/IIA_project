1) title page
2) abstract - Final airfoil data (max L/D, operating alpha...), ro references, important $findings$ and what we did. short
3) Introduction -  why we are doing it, what else has been done
4) Validity of numerical model
    4.a Initial comparison with experimental data - surface roughness, separation bubbles, lift inviscid, drag turbulent, no accounting for compressibility and fast speed is like mach > 0.05
    4.b refinements - the gamma fix, visual turbulent separation warning on wasg,but still only a 1st order bodge as not fully integrate BL and inviscid flow
    
5) Design Process

  5.a) Design philosophy - which curves we focus on to asses things, l/d vs Î±, cp vs x/c, cl vs cd (google), 

  5.b) Low speed story start with naca 15
    5.a.i. 5 revisions, what we are improving in each case, based on physical process( cp and is it separating)
    5.a.ii final characteristics (incl at high speed)

  5.c) High speed story naca 12
    5.b.i  5 revisions, what we are improving in each case, based on physical process( cp and is it separating)
    5.b.ii final characteristics (incl at low speed)
    
6) Extension maybe

7) Conclusion
    




Should address:
 - The validity and accuracy of the numerical model
 - the design process by which you reached your optimum aerofoil sections
 - the optimum sections and their aerodynamic characteristics
 - the physical processes which determine the aerodynamic characteristics of the optimum and non-optimum sections
 - the reliability of results
